# LFS Migrate

This repository is going to contain big files that cannot be uploaded to GitHub.
We will then, migrate them to LFS, rewriting history, before finally uploading
to GitHub.

## Setup

- Source repository:         `file:///tmp/lfssource.git/`
- Working (local) directory: `/tmp/lfslocal/`
- Destination repository:    `ssh://git@github.com/krayon/lfsmigrate.git`

## Step 1: Readme and basic files
